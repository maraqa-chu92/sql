**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my role as a practicum student and research assistant, I engaged in two major projects that highlighted important ethical considerations in scientific research. The first project, focused on developing a novel longitudinal clustering method for phenotyping osteoarthritis, raised ethical questions surrounding patient care and resource allocation. While the clustering method aimed to identify patient subgroups with higher quality of life scores to potentially spare them from unnecessary joint-replacement surgery, it was crucial to ensure that the algorithm did not inadvertently prioritize certain patient demographics or exacerbate existing health disparities. Additionally, ethical responsibility included accurately informing patients about their prognosis based on the clustering results and involving them in shared decision-making processes regarding treatment options.

The second project, utilizing Bayesian modeling to study associations between smoking and periodontitis, emphasized ethical data handling and informed consent. Analyzing longitudinal data on periodontitis outcomes among overweight smokers and non-smokers, ethical considerations emerged regarding patient privacy, data protection, and obtaining appropriate consent for data usage. Discussions extended to the dissemination of research findings and their potential impact on public health policies and smoking cessation interventions. Through these projects, I gained a deeper appreciation for the ethical complexities inherent in scientific research and the importance of integrating ethical principles into every stage of the research process.
